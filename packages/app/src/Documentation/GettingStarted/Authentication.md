# 🔒 Authentication

To make calls against the API, you'll first need to create an account with us, and then obtain an API key.

Create an account with us by visiting [dreamstudio.ai](https://dreamstudio.ai/).

Access to your API keys can then be managed through DreamStudio's [Account](https://dreamstudio.ai/account) page.

## 🔑 Getting Your API Key {#getting-your-api-key}

All [DreamStudio](https://dreamstudio.ai/account) accounts are assigned a default API key on creation.

To find your key, first navigate to your profile picture in the upper right hand corner and click on it.

### 🚨 Important! {#important}

Your API key needs to be kept secret. Avoid committing your secrets to source control.

Someone could drain your credits if your key is compromised!

If you suspect your key has been leaked, first create a new one from your [Account](https://dreamstudio.ai/account) page, and then delete the old one as shown below.
